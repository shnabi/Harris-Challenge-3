# Harris Challenge 3: COVID-19 Data Exploration in Maryland
 
This was the third in a series of challenge problems offered to students of Data Analysis for Public Policy I, 
part of the Harris School of Public Policy's Master of Public Policy graduate program. Using python, I worked 
with realtime COVID-19 data from Maryland maintained by the New York Times (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) 
and combined it with Census demographic data to track determinants of death rate at the county level. Using this data, 
I generated the following graphs:

1. Line graph showing total COVID-19 deaths and cases over time.
2. Line graph showing daily new COVID-19 deaths and cases over time. 
3. Scatterplot showing the relationship between COVID-19 deaths per 1000 people and Black share of total population at the county level. 
4. Scatterplot showing the relationship between COVID-19 deaths per 1000 people and population density at the county level.
